# Django Blog Project

This is my repo following the Exercise 19-1 from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.

Start a new Django project called Blog. 

Create an app called blogs in the project. 

Create a model called BlogPost for the blogs app. The model should have fields like title, text, and date_added. 

Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a couple of short posts. 

Make a home page that shows all posts in chronological order. 

Create a form for making new posts and another for editing existing posts. Fill in your forms to make sure they work.
